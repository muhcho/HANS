        The statue stands tall in the beautiful park in Odense looking over the playing children. If you choose to visit in December do not forget your sleigh! Enjoy a nice walk in the park surrounded by nature and a piece of Andersen’s imagination. The bronze statue of HC Andersen was unveiled on 19 June 1888 in the King's Garden. In 1905 it was moved to Gråbrødre Plads, and in 1949 it was given its current location in Eventyrhaven.

                The bronze statue of H.C. Andersen was revealed on June 19, 1888, in Kongens Have. In 1905, it was relocated to Gråbrødre Plads, and in 1949, it found its current home in Eventyrhaven.
                <br/><br/>
                The artist, Louis Hasselriis, initially envisioned a different design for the statue. However, it never quite matched his original vision. In 1905, the renowned actress Johanne Louise Heiberg expressed her opinion that the back side of the statue appeared somewhat mundane. In response, Hasselriis creatively draped the poet's overcoat over one shoulder, introducing a break in the long back.
                <br/><br/>
                Despite spending considerable time in Rome from 1869 until his passing, Hasselriis was present during a significant competition for a monument honoring the adventurous poet in Copenhagen. Although August Saabye won the competition, Hasselriis persistently lobbied to have his work installed in Odense. This finally occurred in 1888 when the townspeople had gathered sufficient funds to acquire the statue.

            This sculpture explores one of Hans Christian Andersen's beloved themes - romance between inanimate objects. The tale unfolds as the one-legged tin soldier finds love with a paper ballerina. Much like the character's humanization in Andersen's narrative, the artist seeks to capture that essence in the sculpture. This particular artwork is the seventh installment in a series of fairy tale sculptures located in Odense.

                    Fun Fact: Look closely at the gun, which the soldier is holding. Madsen was against guns, so he created this sculpture holding a rifle, which in real life, could never be used.

                Jens Galschiøt (born in 1954) sculpted a striking tribute to the renowned writer, transforming it into one of the city's most picturesque artworks. Comprising three pillars, each dedicated to a different Andersen fairy tale, the sculpture also features a unique bench with legs shaped like feet.
            The pillars, situated around the hotel entrance, draw inspiration from "Clumsy Hans" and "The Steadfast Tin Soldier." The corner pillar pays homage to "The Little Mermaid." Placed between the second and third pillars, the bench with feet adds an intriguing element to the composition. Crafted entirely in bronze, these sculptures contribute a timeless and artistic charm to the city's landscape.
